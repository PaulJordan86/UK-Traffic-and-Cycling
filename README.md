# UK-Traffic-and-Cycling
A project to look at factors affecting cycle use in the UK since 2000

I have written this SQL query using CTEs, in order to summarise and select just the data which is needed to present the
push and pull factors moving people onto bicycles in the UK.

I have used the generated view to produce a dashboard on Tableau, which  is linked here <URL> https://public.tableau.com/views/FactorsAffectingBicycleUseintheUK/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link </URL>
